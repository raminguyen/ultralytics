ü§ñ Artificial intelligence is evolving at a breakneck speed, bringing with it models tailored for various tasks. 
Among OpenAI's recent innovations, GPT-4o and GPT-o1 stand out as transformative tools in their own right. While both leverage advanced AI frameworks, 
their differences are stark, making each better suited for distinct applications. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how these two models differ in speed, 
reasoning, functionality, and potential use cases, giving you a clear roadmap to choose the right one for your needs.'''
